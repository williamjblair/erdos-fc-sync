Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be a set of density zero. Does there exist a $B$ such that
$A\subseteq B+B$ and
\[\lvert B\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert =o(N^{1/2})\]
for all large $N$?

The answer is no. Erdős and Newman [ErNe77] have proved this is true when $A$ is the set of
squares. In fact, Theorem 2 of [ErNe77] already implies a negative answer to this problem, but
this seems to have been overlooked by Erdős and Graham.
