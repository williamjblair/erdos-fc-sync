If $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ form a convex polygon then they determine at least
$\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ distinct distances.

Solved by Altman [Al63].

We formalise the hypothesis as: $A$ is a finite set of at least three points in $\mathbb{R}^2$
in convex position (`ConvexIndep`), i.e. $A$ is the vertex set of a convex polygon.
