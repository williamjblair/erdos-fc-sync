/-- A set `A ⊆ ℕ` is *primitive* if no member of `A` divides another. -/

/--
A set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ is primitive if no member of $A$ divides another. Is the sum
\[\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n\log n}\]
maximised over all primitive sets when $A$ is the set of primes?

Erdős [Er35] proved that this sum always converges for a primitive set. Lichtman [Li23] proved
that the answer is yes. An alternative, simpler, proof is given by Alexeev, Barreto, Li, Lichtman,
Price, Shah, Tang, and Tao [ABLLPSTT26].

Following the convention of [Li23] we require the members of a primitive set to be greater than
one; this excludes $A = \{1\}$, for which the summand $\frac{1}{1\cdot\log 1}$ is not defined.

theorem erdos_164 : answer(True) ↔
    IsPrimitive {p : ℕ | p.Prime} ∧
      ∀ A : Set ℕ, (∀ a ∈ A, 2 ≤ a) → IsPrimitive A →
        (∑' a : A, 1 / ((a : ℕ) * Real.log (a : ℕ))) ≤
          ∑' p : {p : ℕ | p.Prime}, 1 / ((p : ℕ) * Real.log (p : ℕ)) := by
