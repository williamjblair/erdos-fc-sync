Is it true that, if $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is sparse enough and does not cover all residue
classes modulo $p$ for any prime $p$, then there exists some $n$ such that $n+a$ is prime for
all $a\in A$?

Weisenberg [We24] has shown the answer is no: $A$ can be arbitrarily sparse and missing at
least one residue class modulo every prime $p$, and yet $A+n$ is not contained in the primes
for any $n\in \mathbb{Z}$. (Weisenberg gives several constructions of such an $A$.)

The statement below formalizes "sparse enough" via a threshold: is there some
$f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ with $f(N)\to\infty$ such that every infinite $A$ with
$\lvert A\cap[1,N]\rvert\leq f(N)$ for all $N$, missing a residue class modulo every prime,
admits such an $n$? Weisenberg's constructions refute this for every choice of $f$.
