Does every triangle-free graph on $5n$ vertices contain at most $n^5$ copies of $C_5$?

Győri proved this with $1.03n^5$, which has been improved by Füredi. The answer is yes, as proved
independently by Grzesik [Gr12] and Hatami, Hladky, Král, Norine, and Razborov [HHKNR13].

Copies of $C_5$ are counted as subgraphs isomorphic to the cycle graph on five vertices,
i.e. by `SimpleGraph.copyCount`.
