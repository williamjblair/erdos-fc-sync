# Erdős ↔ Formal Conjectures sync status

*Regenerated 2026-06-29 by [`fc-sync-status.py`](fc-sync-status.py). Do not edit by hand.*

This is a **computed** view, not a hand-kept list. It joins erdosproblems.com, Formal Conjectures, hosted Lean proof indexes, live open PRs, and explicit human overrides on the problem number so the status cannot drift silently.

Proof-source marks: ᵖ = [`plby/lean-proofs`](https://github.com/plby/lean-proofs), ʲ = [`Jayyhk/erdos-lean`](https://github.com/Jayyhk/erdos-lean), ʷ = [`willblair0708/lean-proofs`](https://github.com/willblair0708/lean-proofs).

**Coverage:** all 473 problems Bloom marks formalized are tracked by plby ∪ Jayyhk ∪ willblair0708/lean-proofs ∪ FC. No gap.

Reconciled **1217** problems.

| status | count | meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `statement` | 69 | **Write the FC statement + link.** A complete hosted proof exists, FC has no file yet. |
| `link` | 0 | **Add the `formal_proof` link.** FC already has the statement; the hosted proof just is not linked. |
| `needs-statement-update` | 1 | **Not a trivial link.** FC has a file, but the statement or answer needs a human update before linking. |
| `needs-human-match-check` | 2 | **Needs match-check.** A hosted proof exists, but the proof/statement relation has not been audited. |
| `mismatch` | 2 | **Skip for now.** The hosted proof is complete, but it does not prove the boxed FC statement. |
| `hypothesis-conditional` | 2 | **Do not link as complete.** The theorem carries a non-problem hypothesis even if `#print axioms` is clean. |
| `docstring` | 9 | **Docstring note, not a `formal_proof` tag.** The hosted proof is conditional, axiomatic, or trust-extended. |
| `partial` | 8 | **Partial proof.** Proves a variant, not the full erdosproblems statement. |
| `blocked-claim` | 3 | **Claimed outside an open PR.** Skip until the claim is resolved. |
| `in-pr` | 317 | **Claimed by an open FC PR.** Skip to avoid collisions. |
| `wont-fix` | 1 | **Maintainer marked `won't fix`.** Skip. |
| `defer` | 0 | **Deferred.** A human override says to leave this out of the next batch. |
| `done` | 91 | Already linked in FC. |
| `no-proof` | 712 | No hosted Lean proof to link yet. |

Human override judgments live in [`overrides.yaml`](overrides.yaml). They encode known claims, theorem mismatches, and conditional-proof traps that are not visible in the upstream machine-readable sources.


## `statement` — 69 problem(s)

**Write the FC statement + link.** A complete hosted proof exists, FC has no file yet.

## `link` — 0 problem(s)

**Add the `formal_proof` link.** FC already has the statement; the hosted proof just is not linked.

_none_

## `needs-statement-update` — 1 problem(s)

**Not a trivial link.** FC has a file, but the statement or answer needs a human update before linking.

- [330](https://www.erdosproblems.com/330)ʲ — FC already has an open answer-shaped statement; resolving this is not a trivial link-only update.

## `needs-human-match-check` — 2 problem(s)

**Needs match-check.** A hosted proof exists, but the proof/statement relation has not been audited.

- [150](https://www.erdosproblems.com/150)ᵖʲ — Previously dropped from a batch because no hosted proof cleanly matched the boxed statement.
- [202](https://www.erdosproblems.com/202)ᵖʲ — Previously dropped from a batch because no hosted proof cleanly matched the boxed statement.

## `mismatch` — 2 problem(s)

**Skip for now.** The hosted proof is complete, but it does not prove the boxed FC statement.

- [214](https://www.erdosproblems.com/214)ᵖʲ — Hosted proof is complete, but proves an existential coloring result rather than the universal boxed problem.
- [337](https://www.erdosproblems.com/337)ᵖʲ — Hosted proof is a counterexample/existence theorem and needs a fresh match-check before linking to the FC statement.

## `hypothesis-conditional` — 2 problem(s)

**Do not link as complete.** The theorem carries a non-problem hypothesis even if `#print axioms` is clean.

- [205](https://www.erdosproblems.com/205)ᵖʲ — Treat as conditional until the hosted theorem is confirmed to have no non-problem hypothesis.
- [1148](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1148)ᵖʲ — Hosted theorem takes Duke's theorem as a hypothesis;

## `docstring` — 9 problem(s)

**Docstring note, not a `formal_proof` tag.** The hosted proof is conditional, axiomatic, or trust-extended.

[192](https://www.erdosproblems.com/192)ʲ [231](https://www.erdosproblems.com/231)ʲ [237](https://www.erdosproblems.com/237)ᵖʲ [490](https://www.erdosproblems.com/490)ᵖʲ [610](https://www.erdosproblems.com/610)ʲ [658](https://www.erdosproblems.com/658)ᵖʲ [659](https://www.erdosproblems.com/659)ᵖʲ [694](https://www.erdosproblems.com/694)ᵖʲ [964](https://www.erdosproblems.com/964)ᵖʲ

## `partial` — 8 problem(s)

**Partial proof.** Proves a variant, not the full erdosproblems statement.

[264](https://www.erdosproblems.com/264)ᵖ [291](https://www.erdosproblems.com/291)ᵖ [368](https://www.erdosproblems.com/368)ᵖ [485](https://www.erdosproblems.com/485)ᵖ [866](https://www.erdosproblems.com/866)ᵖ [1056](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1056)ᵖ [1095](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1095)ᵖ [1187](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1187)ᵖ

## `blocked-claim` — 3 problem(s)

**Claimed outside an open PR.** Skip until the claim is resolved.

- [45](https://www.erdosproblems.com/45)ᵖʲ — Claimed by a human in the FC issue thread; skip to avoid collision.
- [46](https://www.erdosproblems.com/46)ᵖʲ — Claimed by a human in the FC issue thread; skip to avoid collision.
- [613](https://www.erdosproblems.com/613)ᵖʲ ([#4354](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/pull/4354)) — Claimed by Paul-Lez in an FC issue comment.

## `wont-fix` — 1 problem(s)

**Maintainer marked `won't fix`.** Skip.

- [678](https://www.erdosproblems.com/678)ᵖʲ — Maintainer flagged the hosted proof as not actually complete.

## `defer` — 0 problem(s)

**Deferred.** A human override says to leave this out of the next batch.

_none_

## statement fidelity — 4 signed verdict(s)

Signed statement-fidelity verdicts: a reviewer attests whether the formal theorem faithfully states the boxed problem. A signed verdict supersedes the computed bucket and any matching `overrides.yaml` row.
