erdos-fc-sync — a computed source of truth for the Erdős proof-sync effort.

The problem this solves is drift. A problem's "status" is stored in several places
that update independently:

  * erdosproblems.com (Bloom's upstream status)
  * the Formal Conjectures repo (each file's @[category ...] annotation + formal_proof)
  * the proof collections that host Lean proofs of solved problems
    (plby/lean-proofs and Jayyhk/erdos-lean), and whether each proof is conditional

Reconciling those by hand is what drifts. This script computes the status instead, by
joining the machine-readable sources on the problem number, plus the live set of open
FC pull requests so it never points anyone at in-flight work. It writes STATUS.md.

Sources (all fetched fresh):
  fc      https://google-deepmind.github.io/formal-conjectures/data/conjectures.json
  erdos   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teorth/erdosproblems/main/data/problems.yaml
  plby    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plby/lean-proofs/main/data/sources.yaml
  jayyhk  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jayyhk/erdos-lean/main/data/problems.yaml
  claims  github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures open PRs (REST API)

Run: python fc-sync-status.py            (writes STATUS.md, prints the summary)
